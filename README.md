# twitter-bot-music-insights
A Twitter bot that generates daily music insights powered by Chartmetric

## Motivation
As a data scientist with a passion for discovering new music and helping industry professionals, I created 5 python scripts that are each programmed to generate music insights. Each script, which is outlined below, is scheduled to run weekly on its designated day of the week. As today's music climate is becoming saturated with  more aspiring artists, staying on top of the latest trends and overnight, breakthrough talent is nearly impossible. So whether you're a music enthusiast or this is how you pay your rent, this project is meant to help you. The data source is powered by [Chartmetric](https://app.chartmetric.com/dashboard/artists)
